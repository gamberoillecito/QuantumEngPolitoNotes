# Classical case

In the classical case we have a piece of conductive material (the Hall bar in the picture below) with a perpendicular magnetic field $B$ applied. We pass a current through the bar and we measure the two voltages $V_{xx}$ and $V_{xy}$ (which is the Hall voltage).

What happens to the electrons flowing in the $x$ direction is that they get deflected by the magnetic field and tend to accumulate on one side of the bar, thus creating a voltage difference in the $y$ direction. As the charge builds up, electrons will start to be subjected to a force generated by the electric field (which is opposite to the one due to $B$). This process will reach a stable condition when the two forces balance out and electrons will move in the $x$ direction only. This happens when 

$$
q (\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}) = 0
$$



We get 

$$
\begin{align}
 & R_{xx} = \frac{L/w}{n  e  \mu} \\
 & R_{xy} = \frac{B}{ne} \quad \text{(Hall resistance)}
\end{align}
$$

As we can see the Hall resistance does not depend on the geometry of the sample
